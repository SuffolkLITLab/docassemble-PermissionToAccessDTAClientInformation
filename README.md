Coding the Law Biography 
I started this project attempting to do something with an answer for child support. I gave my quick presentation on what I was going to do regarding my child support answer. I explained that the problem for relevant users was that they would be served a complaint for child support or noy paying enough and they might not know what the next steps would be. The options available at the time were very limited. Masslegalhelp.org was the one place that helped to show what a person can do. It was mostly suggestions about how to fill out the form. The users for this form would be the parents of the chhildren that are being asked to pay the child support. The users are in a tough situation because obviously a a lot of parent wants to help provide for the child in any way they can. The solution for the issue was to create a guided interview that would help the person fill out the form for court. The partner for the form was going to be the document assembly line project. It turned out that topic was going to be a very challening one within the time limits that I had. I had discussions with Caroline Robinson about how to do the project.
